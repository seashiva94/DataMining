background: 2 pages
- concepts: NLP, sentiment analysis, hypothesis testing, 
- literature: user analysis papers
- previous work: trends

approach:
- describe data and how to get it
- method and implementation
 - trends
 - top trending items in restaurants
   - extract keywords and positive sentiments
   - identify which items are trending based on a restaurant
   - suggest these items when users search for a restaurant
   - make prediction based on trends
 - impact of influencers
   - sentiment analysis of tweets for top restaurants in cities
   - analyse the percentage change in popularity
   - find out influencers
   - see how influencer tweets affect these changes across restaurants and cities
   - predict how an influencers review will affect the sentiment/rating in future
   
evaluation:
- hypothesis testing based on the data for influencers

expected outcome:
- influencers affect the sentiment.

fallback:
- if we cant model influencers or if hypothesys testing fails
- then perform analysis to find if other parameters impact popularity
 eg: price rate of top items
 eg: number of checkins
 eg: number of photos uploaded per week
