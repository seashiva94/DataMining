impossibility theorem.

trying to ofrmalize clustering is not easy
need soms restrictions
most algos work on relaxations of axioms proposed here
axioms
	- scale invariance
	- richness:
		any partitions are possible for some distance function
	- consistency:
		gamma transform decreases distances of pts in the same cluster
		increases b/w points of diferent clusters

	- stopping conditions :
	  	k- cluster
		r- distance
		scale alpha

	- using any of the stopping coditions single linkage can satisfy 2
	properties
