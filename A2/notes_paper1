impossibility theorem.

trying to ofrmalize clustering is not easy
need soms restrictions
most algos work on relaxations of axioms proposed here
axioms
	- scale invariance
	- richness:
		any partitions are possible for some distance function
	- consistency:
		gamma transform decreases distances of pts in the same cluster
		increases b/w points of diferent clusters

	- stopping conditions :
	  	k- cluster
		r- distance
		scale alpha

	- using any of the stopping coditions single linkage can satisfy 2
	properties

proofs
	- for any consistent and scale invariant clustering function
	its range is an antichain.. that is it lacks richness

	- given an antichain A, we can find a clustering function that is
	scale invariant and consistent such that its range is A

	- for centroid based techniques, clustering functions lack the property
	of consistency

relaxations
	- thest properties can be relaxed to scale inveriance, richness and
	refined consistency
	- the above are not satisfiable in most cases
	- some cases it can be satisfied when near-richness is needed
